# RouteRunner - Product Definition Document

## Product Overview

RouteRunner is a web application designed for users who need to plan multi-stop routes, particularly delivery drivers. The application allows users to create "shifts" and, within each shift, manage multiple "routes." Each route consists of a list of addresses that can be added through various input methods (voice, text, and camera-based OCR), verified for accuracy using Google Geocoding API, and enhanced with detailed notes and photos. The application generates optimized multi-stop routes in Google Maps and is built with a focus on a clean, mobile-first user experience.
